## Active Root Scripts
The main runtime scripts remain in the project root for quick access.

## Archived Tools
Legacy/diagnostic helper scripts were moved to `archive/` to keep the root clean:
- `archive/connect_pi.sh`
- `archive/diagnose_rc_link.py`
- `archive/diagnose_rc_network.sh`
- `archive/diagnose_ssh.py`
- `archive/diagnostic_uart.py`
- `archive/manual_diagnose.sh`
- `archive/pi_uart_bridge.py`
- `archive/esp32code.txt`

These are preserved for reference but are not required for standard operation.
